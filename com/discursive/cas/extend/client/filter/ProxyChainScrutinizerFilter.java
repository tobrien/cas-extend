/**
 * This Filter scrutinizes the proxy chain described in the CASReceipt
 * session attribute exposed by the CASFilter.
 * It takes a filter initialization parameter named 
 * com.discursive.cas.extend.client.filter.authorizedProxyChains
 * which is a whitespace-delimited list of tokens. Tokens are either entries in the proxy chain (in the same order
 * as they are presented in the proxy ticket validation response from the CAS server) or semicolon characters, which 
 * delineate the beginning of a new authorized proxy chain.  See the accompanying JUnit testcase, the source code, and documentation
 * for additional information.
